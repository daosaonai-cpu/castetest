                <h3>Part 1: Basic Computer Hardware</h3>
                <p>Computer hardware refers to the physical components that make up a computer system. These are the parts you can see and touch. The main components work together to process data, store information, and interact with you, the user. The "brain" of the computer is the <strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong>. It executes instructions and performs calculations, handling all the main tasks. Think of it as the chef in a kitchen, following every step of a recipe. The CPU itself contains two main parts: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which performs all math and logical operations (like addition, subtraction, and comparisons), and the Control Unit (CU), which directs the flow of data and tells the other parts of the computer what to do. For the computer to work quickly, it needs a "workbench" for its current tasks. This is the <strong>Random Access Memory (RAM)</strong>. RAM is volatile, meaning it holds data only while the computer is turned on. When you open a program or a file, it's loaded into RAM for fast access by the CPU. The more RAM you have, the more tasks you can juggle at once without slowing down. In contrast, <strong>Read-Only Memory (ROM)</strong> is non-volatile, meaning it keeps its information even when the power is off. ROM typically stores the computer's startup instructions, known as the BIOS or UEFI, which tell the computer how to boot up and load the operating system.</p>
                <p>For long-term data storage, computers use <strong>storage devices</strong>. The two most common types are Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid-State Drives (SSDs). An <strong>HDD</strong> uses spinning magnetic disks (platters) to read and write data, similar to a record player. It offers large storage capacity at a low cost but is slower and more fragile. An <strong>SSD</strong> uses flash-memory chips, with no moving parts. This makes it much faster, more durable, and quieter, though typically more expensive. All these components are connected to the <strong>motherboard</strong>, which is the main circuit board. It acts as the central nervous system, allowing the CPU, RAM, storage, and other parts to communicate with each other through electrical pathways called buses. To interact with the computer, you use <strong>input devices</strong> to send data <em>in</em> (like a keyboard, mouse, or microphone) and <strong>output devices</strong> to get data <em>out</em> (like a monitor, printer, or speakers). Finally, <strong>ports</strong> (like USB, HDMI, or Ethernet) are the physical connection points on the outside of the computer case that allow you to plug in these various input, output, and storage devices.</p>
                <h3>Part 2: Number Systems</h3>
                <p>Computers don't understand words or human numbers the way we do. At their most basic level, they operate using a system of millions of tiny electronic switches that can be either "on" or "off." This two-state system is represented by the <strong>binary number system</strong>, or base-2. In binary, there are only two digits: 0 (representing "off") and 1 (representing "on"). Each single binary digit is called a <strong>bit</strong>. Eight bits grouped together are called a <strong>byte</strong>, which is the standard unit used to measure data size (like kilobytes, megabytes, etc.). While computers work in binary, these long strings of 1s and 0s are very difficult for humans to read. To make this easier, programmers often use the <strong>hexadecimal number system</strong>, or base-16. This system uses 16 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and then the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F to represent the values 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively. The reason hexadecimal is so useful is that one hexadecimal digit can represent a group of exactly four binary bits. For example, the binary value <code>1101</code> (which is 13 in decimal) is simply <code>D</code> in hexadecimal. This makes it a very compact and efficient way to represent binary data. Of course, the system we use every day is the <strong>decimal number system</strong>, or base-10, which uses ten digits (0-9). Understanding how to convert numbers between these three systems (Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal) is a fundamental skill in computing, as it helps bridge the gap between human-readable information and the on/off signals that computers actually process.</p>
