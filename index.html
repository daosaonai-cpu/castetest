                    Welcome to the Network Topology Quiz! Before you begin, here is a detailed overview of the core concepts you'll need to know. <strong>Network Topology</strong> is the fundamental concept that describes how a network is arranged. It's the blueprint of the network, defining how nodes (like computers, printers, and servers) are connected to each other and how they communicate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's crucial to understand the two primary categories of topology:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Physical Topology:</strong> This is the literal, physical layout of the network components. It includes the cables, connectors, and the physical location of all devices. If you were to walk into a server room and look at the wires, you would be seeing the physical topology.</li>
                    <li><strong>Logical Topology:</strong> This is a higher-level concept that describes how data actually flows through the network from one device to another, regardless of the physical connections. For example, a network might be physically wired in a Star, but logically operate as a Ring (like in a Token Ring network).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This quiz will focus on the basic physical topologies. Here is a detailed breakdown of each:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bus Topology:</strong> This is one of the simplest topologies. Imagine a single long cable, known as the <strong>backbone</strong> or bus, running through an area. All network devices connect directly to this one cable. Data sent by one device is broadcast down the entire cable, and all other devices "listen" for data addressed to them. To prevent the signal from bouncing back and causing interference, a <strong>terminator</strong> is required at both ends of the backbone.
                        <br><strong>Pros:</strong> Cheap and easy to install, requires less cable.
                        <br><strong>Cons:</strong> Very difficult to troubleshoot. A single break in the main backbone will cause the entire network to fail. It's also not scalable; adding many devices slows the network down due to data collisions (when two devices try to send data at the same time). This topology is now considered obsolete.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Star Topology:</strong> This is the most widely used topology in modern Local Area Networks (LANs). In a Star setup, every single device on the network has its own dedicated cable connecting it to a central management device, which is typically a <strong>hub</strong> or (more commonly today) a <strong>switch</strong>.
                        <br><strong>Pros:</strong> Very reliable. If one computer's cable breaks, only that single computer loses its connection; the rest of the network is unaffected. It's also easy to add or remove devices and simple to troubleshoot.
                        <br><strong>Cons:</strong> Its primary weakness is the central device. If the central hub or switch fails, the entire network goes down. It also requires more cable than a bus topology, which can increase costs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ring Topology:</strong> In a Ring topology, devices are connected in a circle, or a loop. Each device is connected to exactly two other devices (the one before it and the one after it). Data travels around the ring, typically in one direction, passing from one device to the next until it reaches its destination. Some Ring networks use a "token" (a special data packet) to manage data transmission and prevent collisions, a system known as <strong>Token Ring</strong>.
                        <br><strong>Pros:</strong> Can handle high traffic volumes well, as collisions are managed.
                        <br><strong>Cons:</strong> A failure in a single device or cable can break the entire loop and bring the network down. Adding or removing devices is also disruptive to the network.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mesh Topology:</strong> This is the most resilient and redundant topology. In a <strong>Full Mesh</strong>, every single node on the network is connected directly to every other node. This creates multiple paths for data to travel, so if one path fails, data can be rerouted through another. This is the principle on which the internet's backbone is built. A <strong>Partial Mesh</strong> is a more practical variation, where only the most critical devices are connected to multiple other devices, balancing redundancy with cost.
                        <br><strong>Pros:</strong> Extremely reliable and fault-tolerant.
                        <br><strong>Cons:</strong> A Full Mesh is incredibly expensive and complex to install and manage due to the sheer number of cables and connections required.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Hybrid Topology:</strong> As the name suggests, a Hybrid topology is a combination of two or more different topologies. This is common in larger organizations. A popular example is the <strong>Tree Topology</strong>, which integrates multiple Star topologies by connecting their central hubs/switches to a common Bus backbone. This allows for easy expansion of the network.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Read these concepts carefully, and then start the quiz when you're ready. Good luck!
